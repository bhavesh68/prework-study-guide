# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who are going through the Prework. 
This project was built to consolidate key concepts from the Prework materials—HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript—into one convenient resource. It helps streamline the learning process, making it easier for boot camp students to review and reinforce what they've learned while preparing for more advanced topics. 
This Prework Study Guide solves the problem of information overload for boot camp students by organizing key concepts like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in one place, making it easier to review and access notes efficiently. 
I learned how these foundational web development tools work together.
